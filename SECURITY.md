## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Responsible Disclosure

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure practices:

**DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

### Reporting Process

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@tmodloader-enhanced.org`
2. **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Brief description of vulnerability`
3. **Encryption**: Use our PGP key for sensitive information
4. **Response**: We'll acknowledge within 24 hours

### PGP Key
```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[PGP Key would be here in real implementation]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

### What to Include

Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Vulnerability Type**: Buffer overflow, injection, etc.
- **Affected Components**: Specific modules or features
- **Attack Vector**: How the vulnerability can be exploited
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential damage or data exposure
- **Proof of Concept**: Steps to reproduce (if safe)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation
